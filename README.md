Snack Store By Oscar Figueroa

In order to test the project you only need to download it, you dont have to worry about the database cause its loaded with codefirst on the memory.

You can Authenticate with this credentials:

Admin
User: admin
Password: 1234

Other Users

User: user
Password: 1234

When you run the project you will need to add on ther URL the word "/swagger" and it will look like this:

http://localhost:63829/swagger

Likes functionality its based on likes as social media, that means that you only can give one like to one product at the time and if you try to give another like it will remove the only one that has.


Best Regards
